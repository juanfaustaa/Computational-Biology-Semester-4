1. Working With Biological GenBank Files (from Bio import SeqIO)
	a. seqA = read from sequenceA.fasta v
	b. seqB = read from sequenceB.fasta v

2. Sequence Manipulation Using Python (cuma maenin array aja sih.. index gitu lah)
	a. reverse seqA v
	b. compliment seqB v
	c. create seqC from the first 20 letters of seqA and the last 20 letters of seqB v
	d. create seqD from the 20th letter up to the 40th letter of seqA and the 11th letter up to the 31st letter of seqC v

3. Sequence Analysis
	a. Determine the melting temperature of seqC using built in wallace (from Bio.SeqUtils import MeltingTemp) v
	b. Determine the GC/AT content of seqC (from Bio.SeqUtils import GC) v
	c. Determine the molecular weight of seqC (from Bio.SeqUtils import molecular_weight) v
	d. Find the Nucleotides Base Frequency of seqC (from collections import Counter) v

4. DNA & mRNA Protein Synthesis
	a. transcribe seqB (transcribe())
	a. translate seqB (translate())

5. Find Sequence Alignment & Similarities
	a. Find the local alignment between seqC and seqD (from Bio import pairwise2 from Bio.pairwise2 import format_alignment
	print(format_alignment(*i))) v
	b. Find the Hamming Distance between seqC and seqD (jika i != j, maka score + 1)
	c. Find the Levenshtein Distance between seqC and seqD (from Levenshtein import distance)

6. Plotting
	a. Plot the GC/AT content of seqC and seqD
