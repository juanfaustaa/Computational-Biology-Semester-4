1. Read the sequence from the FASTA file
2. Split the sequence in half into seqA and seqB
3. Determine the melting temperature of seqA using Nearest Neighbour
4. Determine the GC AT content of the first 20 nucleotides of seqB
5. Plot GC and AT content of seqA and seqB
6. Translate seqB into amino acid
7. Find local alignments between the first 10 nucleotides of seqB and the last 10 nucleotides of seqB
